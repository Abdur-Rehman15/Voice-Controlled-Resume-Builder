# Database Implementation for AsaanCV

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete database system for AsaanCV that includes session management and resume storage. Users can now generate resumes that are automatically saved to the database and view them later using their session ID.

## Features

### üîê Session Management
- **Automatic Session Creation**: When a user visits the website, a unique session ID is generated
- **Session Persistence**: Sessions remain active even when users close the browser
- **Session Validation**: Sessions are validated on each request
- **Session Cleanup**: Old sessions are automatically cleaned up after 30 days

### üíæ Resume Storage
- **Automatic Saving**: Every generated resume is automatically saved to the database
- **Complete Data Storage**: Stores all resume data including:
  - Original answers (Urdu)
  - Translated answers (English)
  - Professional summary
  - Additional AI-generated skills
  - Experience learning points
  - PDF buffer
- **Session-based Access**: Resumes are tied to specific sessions
- **Statistics**: Track total resumes, today's count, and last created date

### üì± Resume Management
- **View All Resumes**: Users can see all their generated resumes
- **Download Resumes**: Download any previously generated resume as PDF
- **Delete Resumes**: Remove unwanted resumes
- **Resume Details**: View resume information without downloading

## Database Schema

### Session Model
```javascript
{
  sessionId: String (unique, indexed),
  createdAt: Date,
  lastActivity: Date,
  isActive: Boolean
}
```

### Resume Model
```javascript
{
  sessionId: String (indexed),
  answers: [String], // Original Urdu answers
  translatedAnswers: [String], // English translations
  professionalSummary: String,
  additionalSkills: String,
  experienceLearnings: String,
  pdfBuffer: Buffer,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Session Management
- `POST /api/session/init` - Initialize a new session
- `GET /api/session/validate?sessionId=xxx` - Validate existing session
- `GET /api/session/info?sessionId=xxx` - Get session information

### Resume Management
- `GET /api/resumes?sessionId=xxx` - Get all resumes for a session
- `GET /api/resumes/stats?sessionId=xxx` - Get resume statistics
- `GET /api/resumes/:resumeId?sessionId=xxx` - Download specific resume
- `DELETE /api/resumes/:resumeId?sessionId=xxx` - Delete specific resume

### Resume Generation (Updated)
- `POST /api/generate-resume` - Generate and save resume (now includes session management)

## How It Works

### 1. User Visits Website
- Frontend automatically calls `/api/session/init`
- A unique session ID is generated and stored in localStorage
- Session ID is included in all subsequent requests

### 2. User Generates Resume
- Resume generation includes session ID from request
- PDF is generated as before
- All data is saved to database with session ID
- PDF is returned to user for immediate download

### 3. User Views Saved Resumes
- Frontend calls `/api/resumes` with session ID
- All resumes for that session are returned
- User can download or delete any resume

### 4. Session Persistence
- Sessions remain active for 30 days
- Users can close browser and return later
- All resumes are still accessible with the same session ID

## Frontend Integration

### ResumeViewer Component
A complete React component is provided that handles:
- Session initialization
- Resume listing
- Download functionality
- Delete functionality
- Statistics display
- Error handling

### Usage
```jsx
import ResumeViewer from './components/ResumeViewer';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ResumeViewer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Security Features

- **Session Isolation**: Each session can only access its own resumes
- **Session Validation**: Invalid sessions are rejected
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old sessions are automatically deactivated
- **No User Registration**: Simple session-based system without complex authentication

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up your MongoDB connection string:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/asaancv
```

## Testing

The database functionality has been thoroughly tested and includes:
- Session creation and validation
- Resume storage and retrieval
- Statistics calculation
- Error handling
- Data persistence

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Users never lose their generated resumes
2. **Convenience**: Easy access to all previous resumes
3. **No Registration**: Simple session-based system
4. **Scalability**: Database can handle thousands of users
5. **Reliability**: Data persists across browser sessions
6. **Analytics**: Track usage statistics

## Future Enhancements

- User accounts with email/password
- Resume sharing functionality
- Resume templates
- Advanced search and filtering
- Resume versioning
- Export to different formats
